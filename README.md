# Hanukkah of Data

Repository with my solutions for the 2024 Hanukkah of Data challenge: ["Noah’s Rug"](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/about/). 

You are given a USB with "Noah’s Market Database Backup" with data about clients and purchases. Now you have to find Noah's rug. That's it! 

Each puzzle involves a mix of data wrangling, processing and detective 🕵️ work. 

To solve this challenge I used the `polars` library in python.
